# Open edX High Availability Kubernetes Deployment

This project provides a complete solution for deploying Open edX in a high-availability configuration using Kubernetes (k3s) on a 4-node cluster with Mycelium IPv6 networking.

## Zero-SPOF Architecture

This deployment has been carefully designed to eliminate all single points of failure:

- **Distributed Control Plane**: Multiple Kubernetes master nodes ensure continuous orchestration
- **Redundant Application Tier**: Multiple replicas of all services distributed across physical nodes
- **Clustered Database**: CouchDB deployed as a multi-node cluster with automatic data replication
- **DNS Round-Robin**: Simple yet effective load balancing without additional infrastructure
- **Multi-Tiered Backup**: Server-side and off-site backup strategy with automated verification
- **Network Redundancy**: IPv6-based routing with multiple entry points
- **Geographic Distribution**: Nodes can be physically distributed for maximum resilience

Every component in the system has been configured with redundancy, ensuring that any individual component can fail without affecting overall system availability.

## Features

- **High Availability**: No single point of failure, redundant data storage
- **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes controllers automatically recover failed components
- **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Rolling deployment strategies for continuous operation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete deployment scripts
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Server-side and local backup options
- **IPv6 Ready**: Works with Mycelium overlay network
- **Geographic Distribution**: Nodes can be physically distributed

## Prerequisites

- 4 mini Ubuntu 24.04 PCs with IPv6 connectivity via Mycelium
  - For more information consult this [Mycelium cluster repo](https://github.com/mik-tf/mcluster) and this [ISO Boot Maker repo](https://github.com/mik-tf/isobootmaker)
- SSH access to all nodes
- A domain name with access to DNS settings
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mik-tf/openedx-ha.git
   cd openedx-ha
   ```

2. **Configure your cluster**:
   ```bash
   cp config/cluster-config.json.example config/cluster-config.json
   # Edit cluster-config.json with your node details
   ```

3. **Deploy the cluster**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Configure DNS**:
   Add AAAA records for your domain pointing to your three production nodes' IPv6 addresses as shown in `config/dns-records.txt`.

See the [detailed deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for complete instructions.
